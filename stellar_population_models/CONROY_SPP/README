readme for alf input files

1. atlas_rfn_v3.tar.gz

This is a tarball of files containing the element response functions for a Kroupa IMF, sigma=100 km/s, and one age/metallicity combination per file (as indicated in the file name; age in Gyr, metallicity as [Z/H]).  Units of the spectra are f_nu.

Within each file, the columns are: wavelength (vacuum Angstroms), followed by the solar-scaled SSP, and then each element enhancement.  In each case the element is increased (+) or decreased (-) by 0.3 dex, except for Carbon which is increased/decreased by 0.15 dex.

Special cases include:

"as" = O,Ne,S
"T+" = Teff+50
"T-" = Teff-50


2. vcj_ssp.tar.gz

These are empirical SSPs based on the new MILES+IRTF spectral library described in Villaume et al. 2017.  Each file corresponds to a particular age and metallicity, smoothed to sigma=100 km/s.  Within each file are models built with a grid of two part power-law IMFs, with a fixed cutoff of 0.08.  The IMF form is a power-law (x1) from 0.08-0.5, a second power-law (x2) from 0.5-1.0, and a Salpeter slope above 1 Msun.  Each row contains first the wavelength (vacuum Angstroms), followed by the 16x16 SSPs with slopes defined by:

nimf = 16
imfx = 0.5 + findgen(nimf)/5.0
where “findgen(N)” cycles from 0 to N-1

x2 cycles first, followed by x1.
